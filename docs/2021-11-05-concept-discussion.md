# Concept discussion

AIs:
- Animation for the beginning of the game
- Watch games with "navezinhas" (goal: ideas for power ups)
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVPX_uqZj8Q
- Revisit game play
  - Life and death
  - Define use of unicorn
  - Necessary menus (settings, pause, etc)
  - More (check section below)
- Hamilton: Send sample sprites
- Everyone: Finish Godot Tutorial

- Full Screen: 320x180 px
- Tile size: 16x16 px
- No perspective
- Games take place in different location (target 1 to start with)
- Use Godot 3.4

- Character Customization:
  - Hair (style and color - predefined)
  - Dress (color - predefined)
  - Skin (color)
  - Name

- Gameplay (Needs to revisit this):
  - Scenarie: Brazil (Rio), Pão de Açucar, city, beach on the forground, sidewalk "calçadão garota de ipanema" style, buildings, get on top of the building (or inside), trio eletrico (stale - but maybe moving as streach)
  - Pause menu, settings, etc
  - Maybe? 
    - 1 shoot kills enemy (Streach: Enemies with given amount of life)
    - Main char with X life (i.e. 3 hearts) vs sudden death vs main char with 100% life
      - Life would be "Glamour"
  - Infinite ammo?
    - Gather from the enviroment?
    - Receive ammo/new guns from npcs? (Similar to rescuing a soldier in Metal Slug)
    - Open wardrobes to rescue people?
    - Dogs?
    - Hidden things in the map?
    - Have cabinets/wardrobes in the map? Open to show things?
  -  Meaning for the unicorn:
     -  Make gun faster
     -  Shield
     -  Make enemies slower
     -  Companion
     -  Get on top of the unicorn (yoshi style)

- Streach goals:
  - Shader: Game starts black and white, then starts to get colourful
